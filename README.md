# blog-api
Simple API Restful to make a personal blog and practice with Go language and others common tecnologies

## Context

This repository is a practice to learn more about go programing language, from the website [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/backend/project-ideas)

## Goals
This is a RESTful API that would power a personal blog. This implies that you’d have to create a backend API with the following responsibilities:

- Return a list of articles. You can add filters such as publishing date, or tags.
- Return a single article, specified by the ID of the article.
- Create a new article to be published.
- Delete a single article, specified by the ID.
- Update a single article, again, you’d specify the article using its ID.

And with those endpoints you’ve covered the basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update and Delete).
